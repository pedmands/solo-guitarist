All I can say, is what a hidden gem! I was nervous about hiring him because he had no reviews. My kids and I watched one of his videos on you tube. He was AMAZING! Our guests loved him. One of our guests wanted him to travel to NY for his party. Great song choices and great musical ability. Hire him today! - Chris M.
